## Overview

This block diagram outlines my soil moisture sensing subsystem and how it connects to our teamâ€™s plant project. The subsystem operates from a regulated 5 V rail powering the sensor, op-amp, and MCU. A capacitive moisture sensor feeds a single-supply, non-inverting op-amp, and the conditioned voltage is sampled by the MCU, ADC on RA0. For team integration, RA1 is wired to Connector 1 (pin 1) which is a digital parallel line, and PWM on RB2 is reserved for a future water pump.
