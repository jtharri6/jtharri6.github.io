For a Version 2 of my soil systemdesign, I would keep using copper tubing for the soil probe but improve how it is built. One change would be using slightly thinner as well as shorter copper rods so the sensor reacts more quickly to moisture changes and fits easier into the soil. Adjusting the spacing between the rods would also help create a more consistent reading and reduce issues with soil packing around the probe. I would also seal the wire connections better to protect them from moisture and provide a secure connection, which would help the readings stay stable. Improving these small details would make the probe more reliable while still keeping the simple copper tubing design.

The signal conditioning and power design could also be upgraded. This can be done by keeping the analog traces shorter on the PCB which would help reduce noise and give the microcontroller a cleaner signal. Switching to a more efficient regulator instead of the 7805 would reduce heat and make the system more efficient. Finally, reorganizing the PCB layout so the sensor parts and test points are easier to access would simplify assembly and troubleshooting. These improvements would make it easier to maintain, more accurate, and better suited for long term use.
