title: Power Budget

## Overview
I made a power budget to find out how much power my Soil Moisture System uses and to be sure all components run safely. It helped me check that my 9 V wall adapter and 5 V regulator can handle the total current and keep the system reliable.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, I confirmed that my 9 V wall adapter and 5 V regulator can safely power the entire Soil Moisture System. The results show that all components operate within limits.

## Resouces

The power budget as a PDF download is available [*here*](nb.pdf), and a Microsoft Excel Sheet [*here*](PB11.xlsx).
