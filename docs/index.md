## Introduction

* This page highlights my soil moisture subsystem, which monitors soil conditions and helps the system decide when plants need water. It covers my component selection, circuit schematic, block diagram, bill of materials, and power budget for this part of the project.

### Project Summary

* Our team is developing an automatic plant monitoring system that manages both lighting and watering to simplify plant care. My individual focus is the soil moisture subsystem, which measures the moisture level in the soil and communicates that data to the main controller. This helps the system decide when watering is needed to keep plants healthy and reduce water waste. My work includes selecting components, designing the schematic, and creating a power budget to ensure reliable performance within the overall system.

### My Contribution

* Designed the soil moisture subsystem and its schematic.
* Chose and tested components for reliable readings.
* Created the block diagram, BOM, and power budget.
* Helped connect my subsystem with the team’s main system.
