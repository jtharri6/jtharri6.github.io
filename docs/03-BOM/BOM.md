## Overview
This Bill of Materials lists all the main parts used in my soil moisture sensor subsystem. Most components like the resistors, capacitors, op amp, and microcontroller were provided by the lab. A few key items, such as the soil moisture sensor, fuse, test points, and JST headers, were ordered from Digikey and SunFounder. The total cost for ordered parts was $14.17 which is well under budget.
